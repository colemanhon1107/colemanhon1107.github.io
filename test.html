   <h1> Trump v.s.kin jong en </h1>

      Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump has long indicated that he'd be willing to meet face-to-face with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- a proposition that has garnered harsh criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and even been downplayed at times by the members of the administration.

But recent strides in Pyongyang's quest to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the US have raised suggestions that the idea of engaging in direct diplomacy with the Kim regime -- or even facilitating a direct meeting between Trump and the North Korean leader -- might not be so crazy after all.
Trump currently finds himself at a critical juncture when it comes to identifying an effective diplomatic policy on North Korea.
After months of escalating tensions driven by harsh rhetoric and military muscle flexing, Pyongyang launched two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July -- indicating that its missile program may be more advanced than previously thought despite years of sanctions levied by the international community.<br/>
The US and its allies in the region have overwhelmingly condemned both tests, with the White House repeatedly telling reporters that it is considering "all options" following the most recent launch that occurred just last week.
However, the White House has yet to offer a clear explanation of how the US intends to proceed -- despite intelligence assessments indicating that North Korea could have a reliable ICBM capable of reaching the US by 2018.  <p>
